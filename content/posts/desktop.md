**2 Years Ago: My Setup**  
![linux?](/images/linux.jpg)

Two years ago, I was running Fedora Linux with the i3 tiling window manager, fully diving into the open-source ecosystem. I remember at the time I had just started watching Linux YouTubers like [Luke smith](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz)
, [Chris Titus](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech), and many others who got me hooked on trying and learning Linux. I also saw it as an opportunity to build foundational skills for working with different systems, terminals, and tools—especially since it was my first year at university. It felt like a great way to get started.

I used to binge-watch videos comparing Linux distros, but honestly, the specific distro doesn’t matter much. Performance-wise, Linux is very resource-friendly, and you can use a tiling window manager instead of a full desktop environment. I liked the minimalist approach of doing everything inside multiple terminal windows. I preferred this model because everything was keyboard-centric—I didn’t need to keep moving my hand between the mouse and keyboard.

I also learned Vim, partly because I wanted to feel a bit superior. But I didn’t care enough to read the manual or learn how to add plugins properly. I used `vimtutor` and tried some Neovim distros/starters, but I wasn’t committed enough to make the full switch. I also experimented with Emacs—it was cool, but I struggled with finger strain (especially my pinky). I eventually remapped keys to make it more comfortable but didn’t stick with it long enough to master it.

I consider this era very experimental—a time when I tried new workflows and ways of doing things. While I liked the experience, doing anything outside of programming or web browsing felt like a pain. I know about Wine and running virtual machines, and I tried Steam since many games are supported on Linux now. Still, going fully open source didn’t work for me. At the time, I was dual-booting Fedora and Windows, but it was a headache. Having to reboot and switch OSes constantly made it feel like I was living as a double agent.

 Tools/Apps/Utilities I Used Back Then

- **OS**: Fedora 37
- **Terminal**: Kitty
- **Shell**: Zsh
- **WM**: i3
- **Bar**: Polybar
- **Application Launcher**: Rofi
- **Text Editor**: Neovim
- **Compositor**: [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)
- **System Info**: [N/fetch](https://github.com/unxsh/nitch)

**My Current Setup**
![linux?](/images/windows.jpg)

Nowadays, I’m using Windows 11 with WSL for development. Everything else runs on Windows—it’s pretty boring, but it gets the job done and strikes a good balance between the two worlds. I might switch back to using Linux daily someday, but I’m not sure when.

I’m also using **PowerToys**, which offers a great set of improvements and tweaks. I use the application launcher, which is similar to Rofi, and it works seamlessly. For development, I use **VS Code**, while I still use Vim for editing dotfiles in WSL. For note-taking and writing blog posts, I use **Obsidian**, and my primary browser is **Firefox**.
